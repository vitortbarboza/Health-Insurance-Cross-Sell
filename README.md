## 1. Abstract

<p style="text-align: justify;">This Data Science Project was inspired by this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction">kaggle Challenge</a> and presents the development of a Classification Machine Learning Model, more specifically a Learning to Rank Model, used to generate a propensity score to purchase a new product for a company's customer list.</p>

<p align="justify">An Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers need to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Car Insurance provided by the company.
With the information about customers, the company did a survey asking them if they were interested in car insurance. With the results of this survey and the characteristics of the customers, the company is able to maximize profit through Machine Learning techniques and identify customers with a greater propensity to purchase a new insurance, since they company only have the resourses to call 20,000 customers.</p>

<p align="justify">The solution was delivered through a "Get Prediction" button on Google Sheets that returns the purchase propensity of each customer on the list. Thus, sellers can target customers who have the highest chance of purchasing insurance.</p>

A demo of the solution can be seen in the gif below:


<img src="media/sample_video.gif" width="800">

<p style="text-align: justify;">Compared to a random selection of customers to be contacted, the machine learning model developed proved to be about <strong>3 times</strong> more efficient, generating an extra gain of <strong>35 million dollars</strong>.</p>

The full solution can be seen on this [Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/igorvgp/DS-health-insurance-cross-sell/blob/a9b98fa99501fc392dcd7942fc1c18b3c4999f20/Notebooks/health-insurance-cross-sell.html)

## 2. Methodology

## 3. Business Undestanding

### 3.1. Context

<p align="justify">The CEO of a Health Insurance company wants to expand the business by offering Car Insurance. The company carried out a customer survey in which they had to answer whether they would buy car insurance from the company. 381109 customers answered the survey and the results were saved in the database along with other customer attributes.</p>

<p align="justify">Now, the company is ready to launch the new service, and the sales team have a list of 127,000 customers to make phone calls and offer the new Insurance. Considering that the sales team has the capacity to make 20,000 calls within the campaign period, the goal is to build a solution that ranks the customers most likely to buy the new service.</p>

## 4. Data Understanding

### 4.1. Main Insights

##### Hypothesis 1: Customers with new cars are more interested in insurance

Result: False

<img src="media/responsesxvehicle-age.png" width="600">

Customers with older vehicles are more likely to buy car insurance.
 
##### Hypothesis 2. Older people are more interested in auto insurance

Result: True

<img src="media/responsesxage.png" width="800">

Customers between 33 and 52 years represent 58% of the interested group.

##### Hypothesis 3. Vehicles that are already insured have lower damage rate

Result: True

<img src="media/pr-insxdamage.png" width="600">

Vehicles that was previously insured have low damage rate.

##### Hypothesis 4. customers with new cars are more likely to have car insurance

Result: True

<img src="media/agexpr-ins.png" width="600">

Most of the new cars are already insured, thats why the hypotesis 1 (Customers with new cars are more interested in insurance) is false.

## 6. Machine Learning Modeling

For this business problem, five classification models were tested using 10-fold cross-validation:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Means
- Random Forest
- XGBost

The results obtained are shown below:


| Model Name           | Precision Top-K CV | Recall Top-K CV |      F1 Score CV |       AUC Score CV |  
|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| XGBoost              |    0.43 +/- 0.0102 | 0.06 +/- 0.0014 |  0.43 +/- 0.0019 |    0.85 +/- 0.0009 |
| Random Forest        |    0.39 +/- 0.0138 | 0.06 +/- 0.0017 |  0.42 +/- 0.0024 |    0.85 +/- 0.0013 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors  |    0.24 +/- 0.0071 |  0.03 +/- 0.001 |  0.12 +/- 0.0028 |     0.6 +/- 0.0024 |
| Logistic Regression  |     0.12 +/- 0.024 | 0.02 +/- 0.0034 |  0.35 +/- 0.0733 |    0.72 +/- 0.0947 |

The XGBoost Model was chosen because it presented the best results followed by the Random Forest model. As the training time of XGBoost model is two times faster than Random Forest, this model was the best option.

## 7. Model Performance

### 7.1. General Performance

After tuning the model, it presented the following results:

For ranking position =  2000:

    Recall: 0.06 

    Precison: 0.43

<img src="media/gain-curve.png" width="600">

<p align="justify">The cumulative gain curve the relationship between the number of customers contacted on the list ordered by the algorithm and the success rate. The closer the cumulative gains line is to the top-left corner of the chart, the greater the gain, the higher the proportion of the responders that are reached for the lower proportion of customers contacted.</p>

The optimum point is about 30% of the candidates, so we can reach 80% of the customers interested in insurance.

<img src="media/lift-curve.png" width="600">

<p align="justify">The lift curve shows how good the model is compared to a random one, according to the number of customers contacted. Ex: Lift = 2 means that the model is two times better than a random one.</p>

<p align="justify">According to the lift curve, if we call about 30% of the available customers, the model will give results 2.7 times better than calling randomly.</p>

### 7.2. Business Results

<img src="media/results.png" width="800">

<p align="justify">According to the information above, if the company call randomly 20,000 customers, the income will be around $ 13M</p>
<p align="justify">On the other hand, if the company call the 20,000 customers with higher probability of getting a Car Insurance defined by the model, the income will be around $ 43M.</p>

### 7.3. Business Questions

##### 2. What percentage of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance will the sales team be able to contact by making 20,000 calls?

With 20,000 calls sales team will contact 52% of the interested customers.

##### 3. If the sales team capacity increases to 40,000 calls, what percentage of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance will the sales team be able to contact?

With 40,000 calls sales team will call 88% of the interested customers.

##### 4. How many calls does the sales team need to make to contact 80% of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance?

With 35,000 calls sales team will call 80% of the interested customers.
